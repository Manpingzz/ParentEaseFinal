Overview<hr/>
ParentEase is an app for parents who believe that "It takes a village to raise a child". This all- in-one platform is designed to help parents manage parenting with ease, while also connecting with other parents and building a community of support. To be more specific, users can register, log in, publish, browse and comment on parenting tips, book available time slots from a list of nannies, and rate and comment on nannies. Nannies can select and publish their available time slots. Both nannies and parents can check their booking records.
